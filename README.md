# Requirements

- Node.JS that supports ES6 (with `--harmony` usually)
- Elasticsearch 5.4+

# Usage

```
# Starting the server (which loads metadata into elasticsearch)
$> npm start

# Starting the GUI (which connects to the elasticsearch)
$> npm run gui
```

> These commands can be run at the same time, search will not *yet* auto-update.
